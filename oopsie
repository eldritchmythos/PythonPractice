Hey, I'm Eldritch, and I chose to do the 2nd programming exercise. I dont have a microphone that works. so I am going to try to show you how I am going to make a module for the dictionary part of my problem.
Oh I forgot sorry but the problem I am doing is making a dictionary of the states and their capitals (I chose to do this from a text document that is a list of states seperated from their capitals by a comma to use as a delimiter when I split that document to make it into a dictionary. Then eventually I will make a quiz that asks a user to type in the capital after being asked a state, then the program keeps track of how many questions were in/correct.

The text document I made to make the dictionary looks like this:

I already wrote the function for creating the dictionary in my main notebook but I am going to copy that into a blank text document and make some little changes and then import it back into my main project.

Thanks for your patience with all this!!!

So I imported the module and updated my function to call the dictionary that was created in the module. Thanks for watching!
